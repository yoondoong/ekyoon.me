          <h3>Problem and Solution</h3>
          <p>The Dartmouth Outing Club runs recreational trips that produce carbon emissions and there is no accessible way to keep track of that.</br>
            The DOC has set a goal to become carbon neutral by 2020. As part of this goal, they aim to reduce carbon emissions from the trips they run. They had a Squarespace website that introduced the DOC Environmental Stewardship Committee.
            However, the squarespace website will not update the data realtime and it is difficult for non-coding members of the DOC to continue updating the website manually. Also, looking for a way to portray their project in a more interesting way. Also, need a calculator functionality
            that estimates the amount of carbon emissions so that trip leaders can use as a tool to decided on the trips.

          <p>
            What would the exhibition be like? What will the stations inside the exhibition be like? What are some adjectives to describe such space?
            <br/><br/>
            One of the struggles for designing in VR was this - how would I create a mockup and a user flow diagram for VR? To address this problem, I used storyboards to sketch out the key scenes of the VR experience
            instead of the pages that are layed out for mobile application mockups. Especially, animation storyboards came in handy.

            Conducting user testing with a storyboard instead of high-resolution mockups was not easy.
            Key scenes in a sequence did not represent the VR experience. And for some scenes, additional explanation about the intention
            was needed that some bias was involved.

          <h3>Building While Sorting Out Priorities</h3>
          <br/>
          <b>Oh No! What Happened?</b>
          <p>
            10 weeks for launching a VR Exhibition on top of school work was a tough schedule even for a five members team.
            As we aimed for a debut in the Technigala, we decided some features had to be modified or postponed for later development.
            Thankfully, the project was selected to continue for another 10 weeks that we could pick the four most important features that defined the project.

          <br/>
          The team was excited to present the Tarsier Goggles at the 2018 Technigala. People from all different ages were interested in testing out the VR experience.
          Staff members of the Vermont Institute of Natural Science, Professor Lorie Loeb, the Executive Director of the DALI Lab, several Dartmouth students, and even
          two kindergarteners experienced Tarsier Goggles with great success. We live played the experience on a large screen so as to let other people see how
          the tarsiers see the world.

            <a>Finalized Features</a>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Importance of Tutorials</b>: It was a struggle to teach the HTC Vive Controls to all the users every single time. Especially for children of young age.
              We prepared a small illustration of the controls, but it was not enough. Perhaps an animated tutorial? Or an interactive tutorial may be more effective.</li>
              <li><b>Focusing Problem</b>: We figured out a bug in the Tarsier's Vision. The focus was sometimes off and would not adjust automatically.</li>
              <li><b>Awe and Excitement</b>: Depth of Field and the Tarsier's Forest were the most popular stations. The visual elements with colors, textures and light seemed to have
              inspired many of the users.</li>

          <h3>Future</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>I am excited to announce a possible <b>collaboration with the Vermont Institue of Natural Sciences</b>. The team is currently working on
            customizing the VR experience to make it more fit for the exhibition. We are planning to add an Owl Vision feature as the owls are more local to Vermont.</li>
            <li><b>Tutorials!</b> Ever since the User Research stage, the team has felt the importance of having an effective tutorial regarding how VR is not as accessible to the public as other mediums.
              We wanted to make a proper, effective tutorial and for another next 10 weeks, it will be number one priority.
            </li>
            <li>The beauty of this project was the <b>flexible scalability</b>. We can add as much stations we want into the exhibition and we are definitely planning on doing so.</li>
